Concerts, lectures, cabaret, theatre performances, festivals and art exhibitions take place here. Since its inauguration in 1900 by Prince Regent Luitpold of Bavaria, the Künstlerhaus has fulfilled the main idea of its founding fathers: it serves as a meeting place for artists and society. The neo-Renaissance building, designed by Gabriel von Seidl, remains a historical monument to the turn of the century."

Located in the historic villa of the artist prince Franz von Lenbach, the museum was expanded with a striking golden wing by Norman Foster. In addition to Expressionism, the collection features 19th-century Munich landscape paintings and a significant array of international contemporary art. The underground 'Kunstbau' located in the subway mezzanine serves as a spectacular venue for large-scale temporary exhibitions. The museum's unique combination of historic architecture and modern design creates a perfect setting for its diverse artistic treasures.
